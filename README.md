# AMLS_Project
Final assessment for Applied Machine Learning Systems Module, includes machine learning models to classify 4 different scenarios; Gender, emotion, face shape and eye colour detection.
A copy of the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file isrequired if you wish to run the notebooks. It can be downloaded from the following link: https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android/blob/master/data/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
Folders are divided into their individual tasks; A1, A2 etc...
ipynb files are used to run the entire algorithm to create and save a working model for each task.
The main.py simply makes use of the saved models to test any input files.
